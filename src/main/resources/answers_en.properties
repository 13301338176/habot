general_failure =       Sorry, I didn't understand. |\
                        I'm sorry, but I can't help you with this. |\
                        I'm afraid I didn't quite get that.

answer_nothing_found =  Sorry, but I couldn't find the information. |\
                        I am sorry, I've got nothing on that. |\
                        I apologize, I'm afraid I have no clue. |\
                        There doesn't seem to be anything matching your query.

standard_hint =         Make sure to tag relevant items with {tags}! |\

                        Here's what I found: |\
                        Hope I got it right, here you go: |\
                        Is this what you wanted?

switch_activated =      Alright, I activated this: |\

                        Okay, I switched this off: |\
                        I just turned off this switch:
